To whom this may concern,

Iâ€™m writing this email to yourself and/or company for an expression of interest in any helpdesk, technical support or technical customer support roles you have posted or plan on posting.

Please find my resume attached, phone number and references available upon request.

Please be advised this email was sent by a python bot of my own design as I enjoy automating the mundan parts of work and life so I can continue working on the challenging and fun stuff.
